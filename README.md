# unbound-config

configuration files for [unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) recursive dns resolver

Settings and values have been derived in part by some suggested
defaults in [docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound/) in order to avoid
some possible interoperability issues and also from the documentation
found at [nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/howto-optimise](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/howto-optimise/)
specifically regarding optimising unbound

## Usage
* Backup existing environment files
```
cd ~
mkdir .backup
sudo cp /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/*.conf ~/.backup
```
* Switch to the /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/ directory
```
cd /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/
```

* Remove pi-hole.conf if you deployed unbound using [Pi-hole documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound/)
```
sudo rm pi-hole.conf
```

Redis Cache DB

Note: Requires [module-config.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/unbound-config/master/module-config.conf)).

Note: Unbound must be compiled with both --with-libhiredis and --enable-cachedb flags enabled.
Check if your version supports this with 'unbound -V', it probably doesn't (but [mine do](https://github.com/saint-lascivious/unbound-config/tree/master/binaries)).
```
sudo apt install redis-server
```

Note: Configure a single memory limited Redis database with an least recently used eviction policy.
```
file=/etc/redis/redis.conf
sudo sed -i '/databases 16/s/^/#/g' $file
sudo sed -i '/#databases 16/a databases 1' $file
sudo sed -i '/always-show-logo yes/s/^/#/g' $file
sudo sed -i '/#always-show-logo yes/a always-show-logo no' $file
sudo sed -i '/stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes/s/^/#/g' $file
sudo sed -i '/#stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes/a stop-writes-on-bgsave-error no' $file
sudo sed -i '/rdbcompression yes/s/^/#/g' $file
sudo sed -i '/#rdbcompression yes/a rdbcompression no' $file
sudo sed -i '/# maxmemory <bytes>/a maxmemory 8M' $file
sudo sed -i '/# maxmemory-policy noeviction/a maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru' $file
sudo sed -i '/slowlog-max-len 128/s/^/#/g' $file
sudo sed -i '/#slowlog-max-len 128/a slowlog-max-len 16' $file
sudo sed -i '/logfile \/var\/log\/redis\/redis-server.log/s/^/#/g' $file
```
```
sudo systemctl restart redis
```
```

## Source Compiled Unbound Binaries

* What are they?
I have compiled Unbound (and its associated toolset) from [source](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound), with some additional features which may not be present in some distribution packages (cachedb, DNSCrypt, TFO).

Example output from "unbound -V" (aarch64 version):
```
Version 1.13.3

Configure line: --build=aarch64-linux-gnu --prefix=/usr --includedir=${prefix}/include --mandir=${prefix}/share/man --infodir=${prefix}/share/info --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --disable-option-checking --disable-silent-rules --libdir=${prefix}/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu --libexecdir=${prefix}/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu --disable-maintainer-mode --disable-dependency-tracking --disable-rpath --with-pidfile=/run/unbound.pid --with-rootkey-file=/var/lib/unbound/root.key --with-libevent --with-pythonmodule --enable-subnet --enable-dnstap --enable-systemd --with-chroot-dir= --with-dnstap-socket-path=/run/dnstap.sock --libdir=/usr/lib --disable-flto --enable-cachedb --enable-dnscrypt --enable-tfo-client --enable-tfo-server --with-libhiredis
Linked libs: libevent 2.1.12-stable (it uses epoll), OpenSSL 1.1.1j  16 Feb 2021
Linked modules: dns64 python cachedb subnetcache respip validator iterator
DNSCrypt feature available
TCP Fastopen feature available

This is (very deliberately) almost identical to the Debian/Ubuntu unbound binary package configuration.

It is safe, but not necessarily recommended to replace the system unbound binaries with those provided.
Any updates to the system package will remove the custom binary.

* What do they run on?
At the present, aarch64 and armhf binaries are provided.

* Will you continue to update these binaries?
Probably, yes.

* Install

Ensure unbound is installed using the system package (we'll use its init scripts and dependencies)
```
sudo apt install unbound
```

* Download and install updated unbound binaries
```
cd /tmp
```
For aarch64 hosts
```
wget https://github.com/saint-lascivious/unbound-config/raw/master/binaries/aarch64/unbound-1.13.3.tar.gz
```
For armhf hosts
```
wget https://github.com/saint-lascivious/unbound-config/raw/master/binaries/armhf/unbound-1.13.3.tar.gz
```
```
tar -xf unbound-1.13.3.tar.gz
```
```
chmod +x install
```
```
./install
```
