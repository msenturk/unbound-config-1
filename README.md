# unbound-config

configuration files for [unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) recursive dns resolver

Settings and values have been derived in part by some suggested
defaults in [docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound/) in order to avoid
some possible interoperability issues and also from the documentation
found at [nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/howto-optimise](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/howto-optimise/) 
specifically regarding optimising unbound

## Usage
* Backup existing environment files
```
cd ~
mkdir .backup
sudo cp /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/*.conf ~/.backup
```
* Switch to the /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/ directory
```
cd /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/
```

```
sudo rm pi-hole.conf
```

## Source Compiled Unbound Binaries

* What are they?
I have compiled Unbound (and its associated toolset) from [source](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound), with some additional features which may not be present in some distribution packages.

Output from "unbound -V":
```
Version 1.13.2

```
This is (very deliberately) almost identical to the Debian/Ubuntu unbound binary package configuration.

It is safe, but not necessarily recommended to replace the system unbound binaries with those provided.
Any updates to the system package will remove the custom binary.

* What do they run on?
At the present at least, only aarch64 binaries are provided.

* Will you continue to update these binaries?
Probably, yes.
