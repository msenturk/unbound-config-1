# unbound-config

configuration files for [unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) recursive dns resolver

Settings and values have been derived in part by some suggested
defaults in [docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound/) in order to avoid
some possible interoperability issues and also from the documentation
found at [nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/howto-optimise](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/howto-optimise/) 
specifically regarding optimising unbound
