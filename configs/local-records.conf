    # local-zone: <zone> <type>
    #     Configure a local zone. The type determines the answer  to  give
    #     if  there  is  no  match  from  local-data.  The types are deny,
    #     refuse, static, transparent, redirect, nodefault,  typetranspar-
    #     ent,  inform,  inform_deny, inform_redirect, always_transparent,
    #     always_refuse, always_nxdomain, always_null, noview, and are ex-
    #     plained  below.  After that the default settings are listed. Use
    #     local-data: to enter data into the local zone. Answers for local
    #     zones  are  authoritative  DNS answers. By default the zones are
    #     class IN.

    # If you need more complicated authoritative data, with referrals,
    # wildcards, CNAME/DNAME support, or DNSSEC authoritative service,
    # setup a stub-zone for it as detailed in the  stub  zone  section
    # below.

    # deny Do  not  send an answer, drop the query.  If there is a match
    #     from local data, the query is answered.

    # refuse
    #     Send an error message reply, with rcode REFUSED.  If there is
    #     a match from local data, the query is answered.

    # static
    #     If  there  is a match from local data, the query is answered.
    #     Otherwise, the query is answered  with  nodata  or  nxdomain.
    #     For  a  negative  answer  a  SOA is included in the answer if
    #     present as local-data for the zone apex domain.

    # transparent
    #     If there is a match from local data, the query  is  answered.
    #     Otherwise if the query has a different name, the query is re-
    #     solved normally.  If the query is for a name given in  local-
    #     data  but  no such type of data is given in localdata, then a
    #     noerror nodata answer is returned.  If no local-zone is given
    #     local-data  causes  a  transparent  zone to be created by de-
    #     fault.

    # typetransparent
    #     If there is a match from local data, the query  is  answered.
    #     If  the  query  is for a different name, or for the same name
    #     but for a different type, the  query  is  resolved  normally.
    #     So,  similar  to transparent but types that are not listed in
    #     local data are resolved normally, so if an A record is in the
    #     local  data  that  does  not  cause  a  nodata reply for AAAA
    #     queries.

    # redirect
    #     The query is answered from the local data for the zone  name.
    #     There  may  be no local data beneath the zone name.  This an-
    #     swers queries for the zone, and all subdomains  of  the  zone
    #     with the local data for the zone.  It can be used to redirect
    #     a domain to return a different  address  record  to  the  end
    #     user,   with  local-zone:  "example.com."  redirect  and  lo-
    #     cal-data: "example.com. A 127.0.0.1"  queries  for  www.exam-
    #     ple.com and www.foo.example.com are redirected, so that users
    #     with web browsers  cannot  access  sites  with  suffix  exam-
    #     ple.com.

    # inform
    #     The  query  is  answered  normally, same as transparent.  The
    #     client IP address (@portnumber) is printed  to  the  logfile.
    #     The  log  message  is: timestamp, unbound-pid, info: zonename
    #     inform IP@port queryname type class.  This option can be used
    #     for normal resolution, but machines looking up infected names
    #     are logged, eg. to run antivirus on them.

    # inform_deny
    #     The query is dropped, like 'deny', and logged, like 'inform'.
    #     Ie. find infected machines without answering the queries.

    # inform_redirect
    #     The  query  is  redirected, like 'redirect', and logged, like
    #     'inform'.  Ie. answer queries with fixed data  and  also  log
    #     the machines that ask.

    # always_transparent
    #     Like  transparent,  but  ignores local data and resolves nor-
    #     mally.

    # always_refuse
    #     Like refuse, but ignores local data and refuses the query.

    # always_nxdomain
    #     Like static, but ignores local data and returns nxdomain  for
    #     the query.

    # always_nodata
    #     Like  static,  but  ignores local data and returns nodata for
    #     the query.

    # always_deny
    #     Like deny, but ignores local data and drops the query.

    # always_null
    #     Always returns 0.0.0.0 or ::0 for every  name  in  the  zone.
    #     Like  redirect  with zero data for A and AAAA.  Ignores local
    #     data in the zone.  Used for some block lists.

    # noview
    #     Breaks out of that view and moves towards  the  global  local
    #     zones  for  answer  to  the  query.  If the view first is no,
    #     it'll resolve normally.  If  view  first  is  enabled,  it'll
    #     break  perform  that  step and check the global answers.  For
    #     when the view has view specific overrides but some  zone  has
    #     to be answered from global local zone contents.

    # nodefault
    #     Used  to turn off default contents for AS112 zones. The other
    #     types also turn off default contents for the zone. The 'node-
    #     fault'  option  has  no other effect than turning off default
    #     contents for the given zone.  Use nodefault if  you  use  ex-
    #     actly  that zone, if you want to use a subzone, use transpar-
    #     ent.

    # The default zones are localhost, reverse 127.0.0.1 and ::1, the  onion,
    # test,  invalid  and  the  AS112  zones. The AS112 zones are reverse DNS
    # zones for private use and reserved IP addresses for which  the  servers
    # on  the internet cannot provide correct answers. They are configured by
    # default to give nxdomain (no reverse information) answers. The defaults
    # can  be  turned  off by specifying your own local-zone of that name, or
    # using the 'nodefault' type. Below is a list of the  default  zone  con-
    # tents.

    # local-data: "<resource record string>"
    #     Configure local data, which is served in reply to queries for  it.
    #     The query has to match exactly unless you configure the local-zone
    #     as redirect. If not matched exactly, the  local-zone  type  deter-
    #     mines  further processing. If local-data is configured that is not
    #     a subdomain of a local-zone, a transparent local-zone  is  config-
    #     ured.   For record types such as TXT, use single quotes, as in lo-
    #     cal-data: 'example. TXT "text"'.

    #     If you need more complicated authoritative data,  with  referrals,
    #     wildcards,  CNAME/DNAME  support, or DNSSEC authoritative service,
    #     setup a stub-zone for it as detailed in the stub zone section  be-
    #     low.
    local-zone: "example-domain" redirect
    local-data: "example-domain 10800 IN NS localhost."
    local-data: "example-domain 10800 IN A 0.0.0.0"
    local-data: "example-domain 10800 IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff"
    local-data: "example-domain 10800 IN SOA example-domain nobody.invalid. 1 3600 1200 604800 10800"
    local-data: 'example-domain 10800 TXT "TXT RECORD FOR EXAMPLE-DOMAIN"'
